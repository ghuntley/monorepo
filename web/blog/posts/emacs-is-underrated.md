TODO: Hello, and thanks for offering to review my draft! The intention
of this post is to convey to people what the point of Emacs is. Not
with the intention of converting them to use it, but at least with
opening their minds to the possibility that it might contain valuable
things. I don't know if I'm on track in the right direction and your
input will help me figure it out. Thanks!

There are two kinds of people: Those who use Emacs, and those who
think it is a text editor. This post is aimed at those in the second
category.

Emacs is the most important piece of software I run. My [Emacs
configuration][emacs-config] has steadily evolved for almost a decade.
Emacs is my window manager, mail client, terminal, git client,
information management system and - perhaps unsurprisingly - text
editor.

Before going into why I chose to invest so much into this program,
follow me along on a little thought experiment:

----------

Imagine you have a computer running a standard, proprietary operating
system.

On it, you use a proprietary spreadsheet program. You find that there
are features in it that *almost, but not quite* do what you want.

What can you do about this? You can file a feature request to the
company that makes it and hope they listen, but for the likes of Apple
and Microsoft chances are they won't and there is nothing you can do.

Let's say you are also running an open-source program for image
manipulation. You again find that some of its features are subtly
different from what you would want them to do.

Things look a bit different this time - after all, the program is
open-source! You can go and fetch its source code, figure out its
internal structure and wrangle various layers of code into submission
until you find the piece that implements the functionality you want to
change. If you know the language it is written in, you can modify the
feature.

Now all that's left is figuring out its build system[^1], building and
installing it and moving over to the new version.

Realistically you are not going to do this much in the real world. The
friction to contributing to projects, especially complex ones, is
often quite high. For minor inconveniences, you might often find
yourself just shrugging and working around them.

What if it didn't have to be this way?

One of the core properties of Emacs is that it is *introspective* and
*self-documenting*.

For a simple example: A few years ago, I had just switched over to
using [EXWM][], the Emacs X Window Manager. To launch applications I
was using a program called Helm, which is similar in spirit to dmenu,
that let me select installed programs interactively and press
<kbd>RET</kbd> to execute them.

This was very useful - until I discovered that if I tried to open a
second terminal emulator while one was already running it would
display an error:

    Error: urxvt is already running

Now if this had been dmenu, I might have had to go through the whole
process described above to fix the issue. But it wasn't dmenu - it was
an Emacs program, and I did the following things:

1. I pressed <kbd>C-h k</kbd>[^2] (which means "please tell me what
   the following key does"), followed by <kbd>s-d</kbd> (which was my
   key binding for launching programs).

2. Emacs displayed a new buffer saying, roughly:

   ```
   s-d runs the command helm-run-external-command (found in global-map),
   which is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in
   ‘.../helm-external.el’.

   It is bound to s-d.
   ```

   I clicked on the filename.

3. Emacs opened the file and jumped to the definition of
   `helm-run-external-command`. After a few seconds of reading through
   the code, I found this snippet:

   ```lisp
   (if (get-process proc)
       (if helm-raise-command
           (shell-command  (format helm-raise-command real-com))
         (error "Error: %s is already running" real-com))
     ;; ... the actual code to launch programs followed below ...
     )
   ```

4. I deleted the outer if-expression which implemented the behaviour I
   didn't want, pressed <kbd>C-M-x</kbd> to reload the code and saved
   the file.

The whole process took maybe a minute, and the problem was now gone.

For those to whom this means something: Emacs is the closest we can
get to the experience of Lisp machines on modern hardware.

Circling back to my opening statement: If Emacs is not a text editor,
then what *is* it?

The Emacs website says this:

> [Emacs] is an interpreter for Emacs Lisp, a dialect of the Lisp
> programming language with extensions to support text editing

The core of Emacs implements the language and the functionality needed
to evaluate and run it, as well as various primitives for user
interface construction such as buffers, windows and frames.

Everything else that people think of when Emacs is mentioned is
implemented *in Emacs Lisp*.

The Emacs distribution ships with rudimentary text editing
functionality (and some language-specific support for the most popular
languages), but it also brings with it two IRC clients, a Tetris
implementation, a text-mode web browser, [org-mode][] and many other
tools.

Outside of the core distribution there is a myriad of available
programs for Emacs: [magit][] (the famous git porcelain), text-based
[HTTP clients][], even interactive [Kubernetes frontends][k8s].

What all of these tools have in common is that they gain the
introspectability and composability of everything else in Emacs.

If magit does not expose a git flag I need, it's trivial to add. If I
want a key binding to jump from a buffer showing me a Kubernetes pod
to a magit buffer for the source code of the container it only takes a
few lines of Emacs Lisp to implement.

As proficiency with Emacs Lisp ramps up, the environment becomes
malleable like clay and evolves along with the user's taste and needs.
Muscle memory learned for one program translates seamlessly to others,
and the overall effect is an improvement in *workflow fluidity* that
is difficult to overstate.

In addition, workflows based on Emacs are *stable*. Moving my window
management to Emacs has meant that I'm not subject to some third-party
developer deciding that my window layouting features will now change
(as they often do on systems like MacOS).

To illustrate this: Emacs has development history all the way back to
the 1970s, continuous git history that survived multiple VCS
migrations [since 1985][first-commit] (that's 22 years before git
itself was released!) and there is code[^3] implementing interactive
functionality that has survived unmodified in Emacs *since then*.

Now, what is the point of this post?

I decided to write this after a recent [tweet][] by @IanColdwater (in
the context of todo-management apps):

> The fact that it's 2020 and the most viable answer to this appears
> to be Emacs might be the saddest thing I've ever heard

What bothers me is that people see this as *sad*. Emacs being around
for this long and still being unparlleled for many of the UX paradigms
implemented by its programs is, in my book, incredible - and not sad.

How many other paradigms have survived this long? How many other tools
still have fervent followers, amazing [developer tooling][] and a
[vibrant ecosystem][] at this age?

Steve Yegge [said it best][babel][^5]: Emacs has the Quality Without a
Name.

What I wish you, the reader, should take away from this post is the
following:

TODO(tazjin): Figure out what people should actually take away from
this post. I need to sleep on it. It's something about not dismissing
tools just because of their age, urging them to explore paradigms that
might seem unfamiliar and so on. Ideas welcome.
