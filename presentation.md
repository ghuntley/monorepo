## A brief history of Erlang

^ Telephones were operated manually at Switchboards. Anyone old enough to remember? I'm certainly not.

^ Eventually we did that in software, and we got better at it over time. Ericsson AXD 301, first commercial Erlang switch. But lets take a step back.

## Phone switches must be ...

Highly concurrent

Fault-tolerant

Distributed

(Fast!)

## ... and so is Erlang!

---

## Erlang as a whole:

- Unique process model (actors!)
- Built-in fault-tolerance & error handling
- Distributed processes
- Three parts!

---

## Part 1: Erlang, the language

- Functional
- Prolog-inspired syntax
- Everything is immutable
- *Extreme* pattern-matching

### Hello Joe

```erlang
hello_joe.
```

---
### Hello Joe

```erlang
-module(hello1).
-export([hello_joe/0]).

hello_joe() ->
    hello_joe.
```

---
### Hello Joe

```erlang
-module(hello1).
-export([hello_joe/0]).

hello_joe() ->
    hello_joe.
    
% 1> c(hello1).
% {ok,hello1}
% 2> hello1:hello_joe().
% hello_joe
```

---
### Hello Joe

```erlang
-module(hello2).
-export([hello/1]).

hello(Name) ->
    io:format("Hello ~s!~n", [Name]).

% 3> c(hello2).
% {ok,hello2}
% 4> hello2:hello("Joe").
% Hello Joe!
% ok
```

## Drag & Drop images

### Simply *drop an image onto the Deckset window* and the Markdown you need to display the image is automatically created and *copied to the clipboard.*

---

* This works with both local files and web images
* You donâ€™t _need_ to drag the file, you can also type the Markdown yourself if you know how
