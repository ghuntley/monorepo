# iDual light control

This folder contains some tooling for controlling iDual LED lights
(which use infrared controls) using a "Broadlink RM Pro" infrared
controller.

The supported colour codes of the iDual remote are stored in
`codes.txt`.

The point of this is to make it possible for me to automate my lights
in the morning, so that I can actually get out of bed.
